Introduction
------------

Welcome to Ruby on Rails! In this guide, we'll walk through the core concepts of
building web applications with Rails. You don't need any experience with Rails
to follow along with this guide.

Rails is a web framework built for the Ruby programming language. Rails takes
advantage of many features of Ruby so we **strongly** recommend learning the
basics of Ruby so that you understand some of the basic terms and vocabulary you
will see in this tutorial.
