What's Next?

Congratulations on building your first Rails application!

We recommend reading the original tutorial's [parts on deployment and production](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#deploying-to-production) and continuing to experiment with the in-browser version to continue learning.

Here are some ideas:

* Improve the design with CSS
* Add product reviews
* Finish translating the app into another language
* Add a checkout flow for payments
* Add wishlists for users to save products
* Add a carousel for product images

We also recommend learning more by reading other Ruby on Rails Guides:

* [Active Record Basics](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* [Layouts and Rendering in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)
* [Testing Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html)

Happy building!
