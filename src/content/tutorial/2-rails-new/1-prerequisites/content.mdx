Creating a New Rails App
------------------------

We're going to build a project called `store` - a simple e-commerce app that
demonstrates several of Rails' built-in features.

:::tip
Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign `$` should be run in the terminal.
:::

### Prerequisites

For this project, you will need ~~Ruby 3.2 or newer~~, ~~Rails 8.0.0 or newer~~, ~~a code editor~~... nothing! Everything you need to build your first Rails application is already "installed" in your browser.

Let's verify the correct version of Rails is installed. To display the current
version, go to the terminal and run the following. You should see a version number
printed out:

```bash
$ rails --version
Rails 8.0.2
```

The version shown should be Rails 8.0.0 or higher.

<TerminalConfigurator client:load />
