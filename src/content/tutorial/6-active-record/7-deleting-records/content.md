### Deleting Records

The `destroy` method can be used to delete a record from the database.

```irb
store(dev)> product.destroy
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  BEGIN immediate TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
  Product Destroy (0.4ms)  DELETE FROM "products" WHERE "products"."id" = 1 /*application='Store'*/
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  COMMIT TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
=> #<Product:0x0000000125813d48 id: 1, name: "T-Shirt", created_at: "2024-11-09 22:39:38.498730000 +0000", updated_at: "2024-11-09 22:39:38.498730000 +0000">
```

This deleted the T-Shirt product from our database. We can confirm this with
`Product.all` to see that it only returns Pants.

```irb
store(dev)> Product.all
  Product Load (1.9ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products" /* loading for pp */ LIMIT 11 /*application='Store'*/
=>
[#<Product:0x000000012abde4c8
  id: 2,
  name: "Pants",
  created_at: "2024-11-09 22:33:19.638912000 +0000",
  updated_at: "2024-11-09 22:33:19.638912000 +0000">]
```
