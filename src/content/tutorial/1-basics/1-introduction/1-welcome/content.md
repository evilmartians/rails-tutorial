# Welcome to TutorialKit.rb

Hey!

Let's learn some Ruby basics together.

Fix the `#word_count` method to pass all the tests:

```rb add={2}
def word_count(str)
  # your code goes here
end
```

Then, open the `word_count_test.rb` file and add more tests to make sure you covered
all the cases.

Happy hacking!
