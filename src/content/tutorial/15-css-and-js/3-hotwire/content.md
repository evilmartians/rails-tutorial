### Hotwire

Hotwire is a JavaScript framework designed to take full advantage of server-side
generated HTML. It is comprised of 3 core components:

1. [**Turbo**](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) handles navigation, form
   submissions, page components, and updates without writing any custom
   JavaScript.
2. [**Stimulus**](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) provides a framework for when
   you need custom JavaScript to add functionality to the page.
3. [**Native**](https://native.hotwired.dev/) allows you to make hybrid mobile
   apps by embedding your web app and progressively enhancing it with native
   mobile features.

We haven't written any JavaScript yet, but we have been using Hotwire on the
frontend. For instance, the form you created to add and edit a product was
powered by Turbo.
